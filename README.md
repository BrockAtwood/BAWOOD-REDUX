#22 State Homework: Redux Store

## Description:

As a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API SO THAT my website's state managemnet is taken out of the React ecosystem.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
WHEN I review the appâ€™s store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
```
